A set of crypto libraries for Swift, written in Swift.
 
## MD5
 
SCRAM is a library that provides SCRAM authentication support on top of CryptoEssentials. Currently only supports the client SCRAM and is mainly used for MongoDB using SHA1. In the future we plan to support the server as well.

## Usage

```swift
// TODO: Please actually generate a random nonce. Don't hardcode it EVER
// let randomNonce = generateRandomNonce()
let randomNonce = "sadasd12u41enwsda"

let scram = SCRAM<SHA1>()

let clientFirst = scram.authenticate("Bob", usingNonce: randomNonce)

// TODO: Implement getServerFirst
// TODO: getServerFirst must send this message to the server appropriately
let serverResponse = getServerFirst(inReplyTo: clientFirst)

let passwordBytes = [UInt8]("hunter2".utf8)

// TODO: Don't crash...
let clientProof = try! scram.process(serverResponse, with: (username: "Bob", password: passwordBytes), usingNonce: randomNonce)

let reply = getServerFinal(inReplyTo: clientProof.proof)

// TODO: Check auth status yourself
while !checkAuthComplete() {
	// TODO: Don't crash.. you've got plenty to live for!
	// TODO: If the server signature is wrong this will throw. Handle that properly!
	let complete = try! scram.complete(fromResponse: serverFinalResponse, verifying: clientProof.serverSignature)
	
	// Complete should be an empty message.. otherwise an error should've been thrown
	reply = getServerFinal(inReplyTo: complete)
}

// TODO: Check if authentication is successful or unsuccessful
```
